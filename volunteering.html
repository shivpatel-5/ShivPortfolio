            <p>On November 16, 2024, I had the privilege of serving as a mentor at FuturENG, an outreach initiative hosted by the Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science (FEAS) at Toronto Metropolitan University, supported by Hydro-One through the WEMADEIT program. This event was designed to engage and inspire female high school students (Grades 9–12) through immersive, hands-on workshops centered around electric vehicle design and prototyping using materials developed in our university’s advanced engineering labs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a mentor, I actively guided students through the design and manufacturing challenges they encountered, encouraging creative problem-solving and offering insight into real-world engineering workflows. I took the initiative to connect with students on a personal level—learning about their prior STEM experiences and helping them translate curiosity into tangible engineering solutions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This experience deepened my passion for STEM outreach and highlighted the impact of mentorship in promoting diversity and inclusion within engineering. Seeing young students collaborate, innovate, and grow in a single day was truly inspiring, and I’m grateful to have contributed to an event that empowers the next generation of engineers.</p>

                <h2>TMU - Open House</h2>
                <h3>Student Ambassador | Toronto Metropolitan University</h3>
            </div>

            <p>During the Toronto Metropolitan University Open House, I had the opportunity to serve as a student ambassador and engineering representative, engaging with prospective students and their families to provide insight into the Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science (FEAS). I guided attendees through academic programs, lab facilities, and student project showcases, offering first-hand perspectives on university life, course experiences, and extracurricular opportunities within aerospace and mechanical engineering.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My role also involved answering technical questions, sharing my project experiences, and demystifying the transition from high school to university-level STEM education. This experience sharpened my communication skills, strengthened my ability to represent complex academic programs clearly, and deepened my passion for fostering student engagement in the engineering community.</p>
