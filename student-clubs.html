                <p>As part of the Metropolitan Aerospace Rocket Society (MARS) for the term Fall 2024 and Winter 2025, I collaborated with a team to design, build, and launch a high-powered G-Class solid-fuel rocket from scratch. Our project included the full development cycle from conceptual design to manufacturing and successful flight.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Leadership Development:</strong> During the Fall 2024 semester, I was selected as a <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: bold;">Lead in Training</span>. In this capacity, I shadowed the propulsion and aerostructures leads, gaining critical insight into project management, resource allocation, and team coordination. This experience prepared me to take on greater technical responsibilities in future launch campaigns.</p>

                <p>On participating in the MARS competition for the second time during the winter 2025 term, I took on the challenge of designing a fully functional avionics bay for the rocket using my 3-D modelling knowledge. It integrated essential electronic components including a GPS module, a battery, and the "Among-Us" flight computer board.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond just housing these systems, the bay was engineered with practical safety considerations in mind: it featured a half-inch bulkhead to safeguard against ejection charges during launch and at apogee.</p>

                <p>As the Industry Outreach Specialist for the CASI TMU Branch, I serve as a bridge between the student body and the broader aerospace industry. My primary focus is to facilitate professional development opportunities for engineering students by connecting them with industry leaders and organizations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My responsibilities include organizing networking events, securing guest speakers from top aerospace companies, and fostering partnerships that lead to mentorship and internship opportunities.

                <p>As an active member of the Aerostructures team, I contributed directly to the hands-on manufacturing phase of our competition aircraft. My primary responsibilities included the precise manufacturing of the main wing structure, applying aerospace-grade epoxy resins for composite layups, and executing the critical mating processes to join major airframe components, ensuring structural integrity and aerodynamic flushness.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I developed a conceptual design for a <strong>Magnus Effect aircraft</strong>, exploring the use of rotating cylinders (Flettner rotors) to generate lift as an alternative to traditional airfoils. Using SolidWorks, I modeled a specialized wing assembly that integrates rotating cylindrical sections between structural ribs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This experimental design aims to harness the Magnus effect to generate substantial lift at lower airspeeds, potentially offering STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) capabilities. The project involved complex mechanical integration to ensure the rotating surfaces could operate smoothly while maintaining the structural rigidity required for flight loads.</p>

My primary focus is conducting comprehensive feasibility studies for implementing Hyperloop infrastructure within Canada, analyzing geographic, economic, and regulatory factors.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, I am actively researching <strong>vacuum pump technology</strong> to optimize the depressurization systems required for the Hyperloop tube environment.</p>

                </div>

                <p>This project involves the conceptual CAD design of a Hyperloop passenger pod, heavily inspired by the aerodynamic efficiency of the <strong>Japanese Shinkansen (Bullet Train)</strong>. The nose cone profile was meticulously modeled in SolidWorks to minimize aerodynamic drag at near-supersonic speeds within the low-pressure tube environment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The current iteration focuses on the external aerodynamic shell and structural ribbing required to withstand the pressure differential. I am currently in the process of designing the detailed <strong>interior passenger cabin</strong>, focusing on ergonomics, safety systems, and life-support integration for long-distance travel. This ongoing work aims to balance high-speed performance with passenger comfort and safety.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Moving beyond the exterior shell, I have advanced to the detailed modeling of the passenger experience. I designed a custom high-speed transit seat inspired by luxury automotive and aerospace standards, prioritizing both <strong>ergonomics and space efficiency</strong> within the cylindrical hull constraints.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The design features a contoured profile for long-duration travel comfort, integrated armrests, and a deployable leg support system. The assembly model (shown above) demonstrates the fitment of these seats within the pod's fuselage, accounting for aisle clearance and structural mounting points, bringing the concept one step closer to a livable reality.</p>
