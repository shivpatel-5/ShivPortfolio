            <p>Over the course of the first week of classes after new years, I finished working on modeling the Airbus A380 in SolidWorks with advanced assembly and 3-D sketching followed by lofting the different parts of the aircraft.</p>
            <p>I used <strong>surface modeling</strong> to model the wings and tail of the aircraft in 3-D. As this model doesn't include the other parts like the engine and other details of design, I look forward to completing the following over the course of the next few weeks.</p>

                <h2>Walking Robot</h2>
                <h3>Mechatronics & Kinematics</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="single-img">
                <img src="walkingrobot.jpg" alt="Walking Robot Project">
            </div>

            <p>This report showcases the design, development, and analysis of a 4-legged walking robot that utilizes a four-bar linkage mechanism (Crank - Rocker Mechanism). The robot is driven by a motor with a gear ratio of 126, and the maximum speed of the crank configuration was chosen for our particular robot design. The objective of this project was to manufacture/design a robot capable of walking efficiently while showcasing the stability of the mechanical linkages.</p>
            
            <p>The research phase of this project explored three distinct mechanical designs from which our group had to choose for manufacturing the robot:</p>
            <ul class="tech-list">
                <li>A Double Crank-Rocker Mechanism</li>
                <li>A Crank-slider Mechanism</li>
                <li>A Crank-Rocker Mechanism</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The designs were analyzed and evaluated using MATLAB coding for their simulation and a weighted design matrix was developed for showcasing manufacturability, performance, and adaptability of the designs. Among all the design configurations, <strong>Design 1: The Double Crank-Rocker Mechanism</strong> showcased excellence in speed, simplicity, and minimal material usage scoring the highest score in the comparative design matrix.</p>

            <p>The selected design features a six-bar linkage that is composed of two synchronized four-bar linkages, phased 180 degrees from each other enabling a crawling-like motion. The mechanical configuration ensured that one leg of the robot maintained contact with the ground during its motion, which promoted continuous stability. The system was analyzed by simulating the mechanism on MATLAB which gave us the displacement, velocity, and the angular velocity of the legs during the motion of cranking and rocking.</p>

            <p>The links of the robot were 3-D modelled using <strong>CATIA V5</strong> which gave us visual information on the positions of the linkages and the distance between every part of the robot. Once the model was finalized it was laser cut onto an 8mm x 8mm MDF (Medium-density fibreboard) sheet. The motor was encased in a casing that provided structural integrity giving it stability whilst minimizing the use of resources. The battery and the motor were friction fit in the casing, reducing the weight of the glue that would be used.</p>

            <p>This project demonstrates how careful mechanisms selection and its analytical modelling should be for creating a functional prototype that can lead to a functional robotic system capable of navigating terrain whilst maintaining its stability.</p>
