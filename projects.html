            <h2>Aircraft Design - DA50 RG</h2>
            
            <div class="project-img-container">
                <img src="project1.jpg" alt="DA50 RG 3D Model and Render">
            </div>

            <p>The DA 50 RG Plane Design Project successfully culminated in the creation of a detailed 3D model, reflecting a personal commitment to exploring aircraft design through CAD software. The project achieved its primary goals of applying aerodynamic principles and modeling techniques to construct a representation of the DA 50 RG plane, with accurate dimensions such as a 38.3-feet wingspan and 29-feet fuselage length. The design process, spanning preliminary research, and CAD modeling resulted in a cohesive model that showcases the aircraft's sleek carbon fiber airframe and unique wing and stabilizer design.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Undertaking this project as a self-directed endeavor has been immensely rewarding, offering valuable insights into the complexities of aircraft design and 3D modeling. The challenges of aligning components and refining aerodynamics deepened my technical skills, while the freedom to explore without academic constraints fostered creativity. This experience has not only enhanced my proficiency with CATIA tools but also ignited a passion for further exploring aviation design.</p>

            <h2>The (Wing + Tail) Skeletal Design</h2>
            
            <div class="project-img-container">
                <img src="project2.jpg" alt="Wing Skeleton CAD Analysis">
            </div>

            <p>This is the wing design of the aircraft for the RC3 Competition, which was 3-D modelled on CATIA V5. A detailed analysis of the sizing of the wing and the stabilizers was done using the constraints given, and also matching the real life speculations of the wing. This is wing has an aspect ratio of 6 which provides a stable and high lift profile for the airplane.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>The wing also uses NACA 2412 airfoil which provides the high lift profile property for the airplane and allowing shorter take offs and stable level flight. The internal configuration incorporates spars and ribs, reflecting realistic load distribution and structural integrity. Both horizontal and vertical stabilizers are proportioned for aerodynamic balance and control authority.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project inspired me to design more aircrafts and build on my passion for manufacturing RC planes which aligns with my interest of working in an aircraft manufacturing company as an manufacturing engineer.</p>

            <h2>The Walking Robot</h2>
            
            <div class="project-img-container">
                <img src="project3.jpg" alt="Walking Robot Mechanism and Assembly">
            </div>
            
            <p>In this project, I contributed to the complete design, analysis, and fabrication of a four-legged walking robot utilizing a synchronized double crank-rocker mechanism—a six-bar linkage system engineered for stability and smooth terrain navigation. The robot is powered by a high-efficiency motor with a 126:1 gear ratio, selected to optimize torque and crank speed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The finalized design features two four-bar linkages phased 180° apart, enabling a crawling-like gait while ensuring continuous ground contact from at least one leg at all times. The mechanical structure was 3D-modeled in CATIA V5 to assess part positioning and spatial tolerances, then laser-cut from 8mm MDF for lightweight, rigid assembly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project deepened my understanding of mechanical linkages, motion simulation, and precision manufacturing. It also demonstrated how careful mechanism selection, analytical validation, and CAD-based design integration can produce a stable, functional prototype.</p>

            <h2>Flight Simulator</h2>

            <div class="project-img-container">
                <img src="project4.jpg" alt="Flight Simulator MATLAB and Joystick">
            </div>

            <p>As part of a team-led aerospace simulation initiative, I contributed to the development of a high-fidelity 6 degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) physics engine for a flight simulator tailored to a newly conceptualized narrow-body twinjet airliner. The simulator was developed using MATLAB and Simulink, with a modular design architecture that accurately models translational and rotational dynamics, control surface deflections, engine thrust response, and aerodynamic forces derived from CFD and wind tunnel data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was involved in implementing structured MATLAB scripts for force, moment, and navigation equations, and integrating these into a Simulink-based block diagram system. This engine processes real-time pilot inputs and features Runge-Kutta numerical integration, supporting external integration with FlightGear for visualization.</p>

            <h2>Gear Box Reverse Engineering</h2>

            <div class="project-img-container">
                <img src="project5.jpg" alt="Gear Box Technical Drawings">
            </div>

            <p>The goal of this project was to design and reverse engineer a gearbox that improves upon the client’s existing product for the robot combat community. The primary goals were to achieve high performance, minimizing cost, and ensuring a well designed product. For design, we needed to maintain the same gear ratio while ensuring the compatibility with the other components of the existing gearbox.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I took the role of designing the parts of the gearbox matching the constraints with the real gearbox. I also helped with the designing of the new gear box with the changes researched by the team members.</p>
